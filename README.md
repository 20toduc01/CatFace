# CatFace
CNN that extracts embeddings from cat faces for verification/recognition task.
## TO-DO:
- Choosing a small backbone model. (done)
- Semi-hard triplet loss. ([alfonmedela's implementation](https://github.com/alfonmedela/triplet-loss-pytorch))
- Dataloader.
- Training on sample data.
- Online hard triplet mining.
- Checkpoint.
- Tracking of loss & some metrics.
- Global orthogonal regularization.
- Vector length loss.
- Some training to evaluate training time & accuracy.
- Finalizing model structure.
- Training, evaluation and tuning.
