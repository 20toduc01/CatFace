# CatFace
CNN that extracts embeddings from cat faces for verification/recognition task.
## TO-DO:
- Choosing a small backbone model. (done)
- Semi-hard triplet loss. ([alfonmedela's implementation](https://github.com/alfonmedela/triplet-loss-pytorch))
- Dataloader. (done)
- Checkpoint saver. (done)
- Testing utilities. (done)
- Training on sample data. (done)
- Augmentation. (only changes brightness and contrast)
- Tracking of some metrics. (loss only)
- Global orthogonal regularization (done)
- Vector length loss. (?)
- Some training to evaluate training time & accuracy.
- Finalizing model structure.
- Training, evaluation and tuning.
